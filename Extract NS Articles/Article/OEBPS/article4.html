<p>SOME people in the US may have been wrongly executed because of inaccuracies in the IQ tests used to assess them.</p>
<p>Simon Whitaker, a psychologist at the University of Huddersfield, UK, searched the literature to identify sources of error in the most commonly used IQ tests. The test manuals state that you can be 95 per cent confident that a person's true IQ lies within 4 points of their test score. However, Whitaker found that for people with extremely poor scores, their actual IQ could be up to 28 points lower than the score achieved.</p>
<p>In 2002, the US Supreme Court ruled that the execution of any mentally retarded person violates US law. An IQ of 70 is generally considered the threshold - making Teresa Lewis (IQ 72), who was executed in September last year, a borderline case.</p>
<p>Whitaker calculates that to guarantee that no one with an IQ of less than 70 is executed, a test score of 88 or more is required. He reported his findings at the British Psychological Society conference in Glasgow, UK, last week.</p>
