<p>DRILLING for shale gas may pose a safety hazard if there are water wells nearby.</p>
<p>Explosions at drinking wells in the US have been linked to dissolved methane in the water. Now Rob Jackson of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, has found that wells located within 1 kilometre of an active shale-gas drilling site contained 17 times as much methane on average as those further away (<i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1100682108).</p>
<p>While little is known about how this methane might affect health, its presence at elevated levels is an explosion hazard, says Jackson, who analysed water from 68 wells in Pennsylvania and upstate New York.</p>
<p>Jackson says the methane is probably seeping out from cracks in gas well casings, so improving the way these are sealed should solve the problem.</p>
<p>Bryan Swistock, a water resources expert at Pennsylvania State University, University Park, says that the state has already introduced new standards for casing and sealing gas wells. "It would be interesting to continue this study [now the new standards are in place]," he says.</p>
