<p><b>Roomier moon trips</b></p>
<p>Good news for claustrophobic would-be space tourists: Virginia-based firm Space Adventures says its planned week-long "circumlunar" trips, for two passengers and a pilot, will use an 8-cubic-metre habitation module in addition to Russia's 10-cubic-metre Soyuz spacecraft. The $150 million trips could begin as early as 2015.</p>
<p><b>Clothes too sexy</b></p>
<p>Almost 30 per cent of clothes aimed at young girls in 15 popular online stores in the US are overtly sexualising and could influence the way girls evaluate themselves, say researchers at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. For instance, dresses are often cut in a way to create the appearance of breasts (<i>Sex Roles</i>, DOI: 10.1007/s11199-011-9966-8).</p>
<p><b>Warming hits food</b></p>
<p>Global warming is taking its toll on our food, according to the first study to show a link between global crop yields and climate change. A steep rise in temperatures since 1980 has cut yields of staple crops, offsetting gains from improved farming practices (<i>Science</i>, DOI: 10.1126/science.1204531).</p>
<p><b>Soyuz's new spaceport</b></p>
<p>Engineers simulated a launch of Russia's Soyuz rocket at Europe's spaceport in French Guiana last week, paving the way for the rocket's first lift-off from there in October. Soyuz launches from the South American port will be uncrewed.</p>
<p><b>Ova the odds</b></p>
<p>How many eggs should you take to make a test-tube baby? The answer, according to an analysis of 400,000 IVF cycles, is no more than 15. In instances where more were taken through over-stimulation of the ovaries, the chances of a successful pregnancy were reduced and the risk of complications was raised (<i>Human Reproduction</i>, DOI: 10.1093/humrep/der106).</p>
