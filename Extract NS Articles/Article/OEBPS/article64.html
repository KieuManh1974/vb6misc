			Animatronic dinosaurs set in their world
		
		</h2>
<p><i>A new exhibition at the Natural History Museum in London recreates dinosaurs in their environment and presents the latest dino-science</i></p>
<p>COULD you identify <i>T. rex</i> in a dinosaur line-up? Easy? Ok then, how about naming the prehistoric period they lived in, how and what the giant beasts ate, and what other creatures shared the landscape?</p>
<p>If you got stuck after the first question, the new Age of the Dinosaur exhibition at London's Natural History Museum will remedy that. Unlike other big dinosaur shows that can focus narrowly on the usual suspects while skimping on context, this aims higher, surrounding the dinosaurs with the animals, plants, marine life and flying reptiles of their era.</p>
<p>The idea was to create an immersive and accurate landscape, says museum palaeontologist Paul Barrett. "It's like a time machine with the dial set to 70 million years BC."</p>
<p>At the start of their journey back in time, visitors are greeted with a huge replica of a <i>T. rex</i> footprint - a hint at the size of things to come. Working through the Jurassic period and then into the Cretaceous era, the exhibition features giant fossils, interactive games, video footage and of course - the part the kids go mad for - life-sized animatronic models.</p>
<p>Meticulously designed, much of the content of the exhibition is based on research conducted at the museum and reflects new discoveries about what dinosaurs looked like, how they heard, ate and behaved. Visitors learn, for example, that researchers in Bhutan and China have discovered melanosomes - parts of pigment cells - in fossilised feathers and feather-like structures of birds and dinosaurs, and used electron microscopy to study the cells and determine what colour these were.</p>
<p>Barrett hopes that showing the scientific method behind such discoveries will prompt visitors to question commonly accepted wisdom about these prehistoric beasts. "We wanted to tell people how we decided what we think, and ask them to make their own minds up."</p>
<p>The exhibition isn't extensive, and with only two rooms of animatronics, some visitors might feel short-changed compared with some of the more technologically advanced dino-shows. But this content-rich, immersive and thought-provoking exhibition is well judged - it's the perfect length to hold your attention throughout, and adds up to a whole lot more than a mug shot of <i>T. rex</i>.</p>
<p>Age of the Dinosaur, Natural History Museum, London, 22 April - 4 September</p>
