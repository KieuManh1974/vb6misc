			The endless possibilities of life in the cosmos

<p><i>We need to spread our search for alien life as imaginatively as we can</i></p>
<p>"IT IS unnatural in a large field to have only one shaft of wheat, and in the infinite universe only one living world." That saying, attributed to the pre-Socratic philosopher Metrodorus of Chios, has a strangely modern ring to it.</p>
<p>Over the following centuries, religious sensibilities, perhaps combined with an overdeveloped sense of our own importance, contrived to convince us that humanity must occupy a unique place in the universe. But the 20th century largely knocked that out of us. We now know that the universe is, if not infinite, almost unimaginably vast, and that our galaxy alone is populated with many billions of stars rather like our own.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, Frank Drake, the American radio astronomer and pioneer of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, calculated what that meant for the likelihood of life elsewhere in the Milky Way. His conclusion: the huge numbers involved made it rather implausible that we are alone.</p>
<p>Half a century on, and the tide might be turning again. Waves of discoveries from NASA's orbiting Kepler planet-hunter have given us the chance to test some of the assumptions in Drake's formula for the first time. The fact that there are few plausible Earth lookalikes among the 1200-plus candidate planets identified by Kepler is not hard to explain away. Such small lumps of rock are more elusive than bigger gassy bodies, and once they have been glimpsed it will take time to verify their existence. More perplexing is the apparent lack of any other solar systems that have the familiar qualities of our own, which we believe to have given rise to life (see "No place like home: Our lonesome solar system").</p>
<p>That's a blow to our ideas of how solar systems form and develop. Those who believe in humanity's uniqueness may claim that this lack of an alter ego for Earth supports their view.</p>
<p>We may, however, be focusing our search too narrowly. The diversity of planetary systems that we are now seeing raises the possibility that planets or solar systems quite unlike the ones we know might harbour life. This week, NASA gave the go-ahead for further exploratory work on a lander to dip into one of Titan's frigid methane seas (see "NASA floats Titan boat concept"). Though the chances are we won't find much more than some chemically interesting goo there, discovering anything lifelike would break down long-standing assumptions, notably that life requires liquid water.</p>
<p>Further afield, things are looking ever more interesting. Just a few weeks ago we were presented with the idea that dark matter could warm planets enough to host life even without a star. Slightly more prosaically, we report in this issue on the possibility of hydrogen-enveloped life-supporting planets far from their stars ("Alien life may huddle under hydrogen blankets").</p>
<p>If life does exist in such diverse environments, it is a reasonable assumption that it will differ from us in other fundamental ways, too. Uniqueness seems rather too presumptuous a claim for one small planet in an undistinguished corner of a vast cosmos. Given our imperfect but rapidly growing store of knowledge, the idea that life can take many forms that to us will seem utterly exotic looks increasingly plausible. Perhaps we are indeed the lone shaft of wheat - but in a large field sown with many different crops.</p>
