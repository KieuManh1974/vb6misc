			Weird and wild underwater creatures
		
		</h2>
<p>THERE is no shortage of fascinating candidates for Ellen Prager's celebration of the oceans' most bizarre creatures. Among those making an appearance in <i>Sex, Drugs and Sea Slime</i> you will find the ferocious sand tiger shark, which attacks and kills its siblings while still in its mother's womb; the barreleye fish that sports tubular eyes within a transparent head; and the queen conch, a snail that is endowed with a penis half the length of its body.</p>
<p>Prager makes a case for each animal's unique value to humankind, but at times her arguments seem a bit hit-or-miss. Coral reefs are indeed important for their potential medicinal benefits, but should we really care about seahorses simply because they were used as a cure for baldness in Roman times?</p>
<p>It's a great cast of characters, and Prager's style is accessible and at times amusing. But after a couple of chapters, her efforts to include as many creatures as possible - instead of giving fewer species in-depth treatment - make the book feel less like a manifesto on the marvels of marine animals and more like a futile attempt to list them all.</p>
