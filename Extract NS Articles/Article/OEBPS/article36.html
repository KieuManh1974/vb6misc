<p>Regarding the "Lonesome galaxy" feature (2 April, p 37)<img src="/img/icon/artx_video.gif" alt="Movie Camera" title="Contains video content" class="artxicon" />. In terms of what you can see with the naked eye, for the most part the universe is already a dark, lonely place. The only reason we see anything at night this way is because we are located in a galaxy that is itself located in the middle of a group of galaxies.</p>
<p>Other than the stars in the Milky Way, without a telescope pretty much all we can see is four or five barely visible galaxies.</p>
<p>And the only reason we can see them is because they are part of the Local Group of galaxies, which are nearby and gravitationally bound to us.</p>
<p>If you were suddenly transported to a random spotin the universe, the chances are that the sky would be completely dark.</p>
