<p>FORGET money, fame and looks. The best chance of happiness comes from two copies of a particular gene.</p>
<p>That's true, at least, for 2574 people enrolled in the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, who answered a questionnaire about their satisfaction with life and underwent genomic tests. This allowed Jan-Emmanuel De Neve of the London School of Economics to establish that respondents who had two long versions of the <i>5-HTTLPR</i> gene were twice as likely to say they were satisfied with life as those with two short versions of the gene.</p>
<p><i>5-HTTLPR</i> makes a transporter molecule for serotonin, a chemical that brain cells use to communicate with each other, and the long version speeds up its processing (<i>Journal of Human Genetics</i>, DOI: 10.1038/jhg.2011.39).</p>
<p>"It's the first formal finding of a happiness gene," says De Neve, but he expects others will be found. He also stresses that many other factors play into happiness: "If you're unlucky throughout life, it will be a more important source of unhappiness than any particular genes."</p>
