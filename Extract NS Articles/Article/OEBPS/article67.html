			Animals â€“ a design triumph
		
		</h2>
<p>ANIMALS are machines: walking, running, crawling, flying, sensing machines. So say retired aerospace engineer Mark Denny and his co-author, independent consultant Alan McFadzean, who in this book examine these machines with the critical eyes of engineers, investigating the technical workings of animal adaptations from snail slime to sonar.</p>
<p>Both physiology primer and engineering textbook, <i>Engineering Animals</i> covers the basics of how physics constrains animal structure and function, all the while marvelling at nature's exquisite and often surprising solutions.</p>
<p>Optimisation is a key theme. All animals are faced with environmental challenges - find food, find a mate, stay alive - to which there will be theoretically optimal solutions. An engineer will calculate this optimum; a biologist will marvel at the solution achieved within the constraints of the animal's evolutionary history. This book combines both approaches to nature appreciation.</p>
<p>The adaptations can be superb. Consider the giraffe, which has a 12-kilogram heart to pump blood at high pressure up to its head. Or the albatross, which can fly over 1000 kilometres per day thanks to a clever skeletal shoulder-locking mechanism which keeps its wings outstretched.</p>
<p>Framing adaptations as solutions to distinct environmental challenges, Denny and McFadzean do well to avoid the adaptationist fallacy of Dr Pangloss from Voltaire's <i>Candide</i>, who claimed that "the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles".</p>
<p><i>Engineering Animals</i> is rather a celebration of nature's ingenuity. There may be a few equations but don't let that put you off - this is an engaging journey through animal adaptation for engineers and non-engineers alike.</p>
