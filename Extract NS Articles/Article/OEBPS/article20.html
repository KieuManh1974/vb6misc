			Beleaguered mission measures swirling space-time at last

<p>SIX years after NASA's Gravity Probe B stopped collecting data, the mission has finally found evidence of an effect of general relativity called frame-dragging. But the result comes years after other projects measured the effect to greater precision.</p>
<p>The $750 million mission launched in 2004 to test Einstein's general theory of relativity by measuring how Earth warps the fabric of space-time. The warping was expected to slightly alter the spin axis of four gyroscopes in the probe, but the measurements were much noisier than expected, complicating the analysis.</p>
<p>In 2007, the probe's team reported measuring the dent Earth's gravity makes in space. But evidence that the Earth drags space around with it as it spins - frame-dragging - was more elusive.</p>
<p>Last week, mission members said in a press conference that they had detected frame-dragging with a precision of 19 per cent. However, laser tracking of the moon's motion had already reached a precision of 0.1 per cent. Despite this, Francis Everitt of Stanford University in California, who began work on Gravity Probe B about 50 years ago, defends the mission. "The great beauty of it is that we have complementary tests of general relativity," he says.</p>
