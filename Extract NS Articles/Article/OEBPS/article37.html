<p>The idea that fast evolution is the norm (2 April, p 32) doesn't wash. Researchers in the field do consistently observe rapid evolution because that is all the evolution that can take place in the short time spans they are looking at. But a rapid-evolution model is not well suited to explaining the gradual divergence and specialisation of gene sequences, or the generation of completely new protein products and adaptations.</p>
<p>Both of these aspects are aptly addressed by the "slow" model of evolution. Most tellingly, the examples of rapid evolution cited involve deletion, reinstatement or duplication of existing traits and upregulation - the increased expression of an existing gene.</p>
<p>These constitute basic rewirings of the developmental genetic circuitry, but I believe that most biologists would be hard-pressed to count these examples of rapid evolution as genetic "innovation".</p>
<p>In other words, slow evolution is still the norm; it just takes time.</p>
<p><i>From Ben Haller, McGill University</i></p>
<p>I'd like to praise you for your recent article on rapid evolution.</p>
<p>It was well written and interesting, got the facts right, didn't lead with a "Darwin was wrong!" teaser and it quoted evolutionary biologists.</p>
<p>The cover picture was beautiful, too, although I can't resist a little nit-picking; Stephen Jay Gould would have been displeased by its implication that humans are the pinnacle of evolution.</p>
