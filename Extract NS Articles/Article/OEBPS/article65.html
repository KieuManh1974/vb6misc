			Has our neuro-obsession gone too far?
		
		</h2>
<p>IN 2007 <i>The New York Times</i> ran an article about using brain imaging to predict the eventual choices of undecided voters in a presidential primary. This is the sort of thing that drives the authors of this strange little book up the wall. As they see it, modern neuroscience is not only overreaching itself, but is also positively dangerous.</p>
<p>From the familiar problem of brain imaging creating overly simplistic pictures of brain function to bandwagon-jumping "neuro" disciplines like neuroeconomics, Paolo Legrenzi and Carlo Umilt√† - distinguished Italian psychologists - argue that we have been collectively seduced by brain science's hubris.</p>
<p>That may be so. But to conclude that this has serious implications for society is overstatement. In their opinion, our faith in neuroscience is an insidious form of biological determinism that will lead us into an ethical quagmire on issues such as "life, death, copulation, abortion, bringing up children, and so on". The result is a rather curmudgeonly rant against the modern world.</p>
