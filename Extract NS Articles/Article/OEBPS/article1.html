			Privacy in the age of Facebook
		
		</h2>
<p>WEBSITES, smartphone apps and online services all make our lives easier, but recent privacy breaches and leaks of data show that convenience can come at a cost.</p>
<p>As household names such as Apple, Amazon and Sony hit the headlines over their data use, many people are realising that they can't rely on big brands to protect their personal data, even as these companies push for us to store ever more information online.</p>
<p>Though there is little you can do once a company has lost your data, there is a better way to be vigilant (see "Taking control of your data into your own hands"). An app is being developed that will let users monitor the transmission of their information, providing "privacy revelations" about how data flows through apps and to the internet. Combining it with crowdsourcing would allow users to warn others about rogue apps.</p>
<p>But this will only work if enough people are interested. In a world where so many people volunteer intimate personal details on Facebook, how many will see the need to become their own network administrator? It would be a pity if more significant leaks were needed to make everyone put a higher premium on privacy.</p>
