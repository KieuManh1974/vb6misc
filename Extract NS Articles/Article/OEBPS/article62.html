<p><b>Editorial: </b>"The endless possibilities of life in the cosmos"</p>
<p><i>Two decades of searching have failed to turn up another planetary system like ours. Should we be worried?</i></p>
<p>IT WAS David Latham's misfortune that his email was time-stamped 1 April 1988. An astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he was engaged in the then faintly disreputable task of searching for planets orbiting other stars. As he excitedly wrote to a colleague, he had found something: a body orbiting an ordinary yellow star, known only by its catalogue designation HD 114762, some 130 light years from Earth.</p>
<p>For Latham's peers, this was nothing more than an April Fool. If the object had been a planet, it would have gone against all we thought we knew about how planets - and indeed solar systems - could look.</p>
<p>Two decades on, planet-hunting is high fashion, and Latham has been vindicated. With hundreds of worlds known and more being discovered every week, planets and solar systems that break the rules are commonplace. In fact, they could well be the rule. It's time to ask the question: is our solar system actually the odd one out?</p>
<p>Sophisticated ideas about the formation and evolution of planetary systems go back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who in 1755 noted that the solar system's planets all orbit in the same plane around the sun's equator. This led him to the "nebular hypothesis": that the sun formed as a great cloud of gas and dust collapsed inward, and worlds coalesced in a spinning disc of material around its midriff. Looking to the heavens, Kant saw fuzzy spiral wisps that he interpreted as such nascent solar systems.</p>
<p>We now know these are galaxies, not solar systems, but the nebular hypothesis has remained at the heart of our ideas about planetary formation. Four decades after Kant first proposed it, the French mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace reformulated the theory in the precise, calculable terms of Newtonian gravity. Recently, computers capable of crunching through many millennia of world-making in a single afternoon have allowed us to model the process and produce a menagerie of planets like those in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p>And so we came to believe that our solar system's story was universal. "Politically, socially, religiously - it's human nature to adopt the environments within which we live as universal norms," says Geoff Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, the doyen of planet hunters who has more confirmed alien worlds to his name than anyone else.</p>
<p>The idea that planets coalesced serenely from a rotating disc of gas and dust led to a seemingly reasonable set of rules about how solar systems should look. First, only rocky planets resembling Earth and Mars could populate the hot inner regions close to a star; giant planets like Jupiter would be restricted to the cooler outer regions, where ice, gas and dust can readily stick together and snowball to enormous sizes. Second, giant planets could not grow much bigger than Jupiter before their feedstock of gas and dust would be depleted. Third, planets would have more or less circular orbits in a plane around their star's equator.</p>
<p>Latham's putative planet broke all three rules. It had an estimated mass 11 times that of Jupiter, yet was close to its star, with an orbit similar to Mercury's in our solar system. It also raced around its orbit in a highly eccentric manner, tracing a squashed, elongated oval rather than a near-perfect circle.</p>
<p>"The theoreticians weren't ready to accept it," says Latham. "It was three strikes and you're out." By the time he and his colleagues came to publish a paper about their discovery in May 1989, they meekly termed it a "probable brown dwarf" - in other words, a failed star (<i>Nature</i>, vol 339, p 38).</p>
<p>In the event, it was a drop of rain before a storm. In 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland discovered a gas-giant planet with a mass similar to Jupiter's in a scorching four-day orbit around the sun-like star 51 Pegasi (<i>Nature</i>, vol 378, p 355). Within a year, Marcy and his colleague Paul Butler, both then at San Francisco State University in California, had confirmed that discovery, and also found two more "hot Jupiters". Later that year, they confirmed Latham's discovery as a planet.</p>
<p>It was clear we had ignored a fundamental rule of science. "We had been judging the cosmic diversity of planetary systems based on a sample size of one," says Marcy.</p>
<p>If these were the first hints that our solar system was not normal, they were not the last. Other planets were soon caught breaking all sorts of rules: orbiting in the opposite direction to their star's spin, coming packed in close orbits like sardines in a can, or revolving on wildly tilted orbits far away from their star's equator (see diagram).</p>
<p>There are many good reasons to believe that planets do form in circular orbits in more or less the same plane, as Kant had suggested. But it appears they do not always stay that way. Soon enough, theorists began to supply the necessary creation stories. Young worlds might drag against dust and gas yet to be hoovered up into a planet, losing momentum and spiralling inwards towards their star to be consumed or, perhaps, to become hot Jupiters. Others might tussle gravitationally with another member of their brood, with the loser being flung out into the void and the winner left in a disturbed, elliptical orbit.</p>
<p>The reality of such restless young planets soon began to rewrite our solar system's history, too. Uranus and Neptune seem rather large for their positions in the extremities of the solar system, where the sluggish pace of detritus orbiting the sun would have slowed the accretionary processes of planet-building. It is plausible that they formed closer to Jupiter and Saturn, and a gravitational tussle between these two giants scattered them out to their present orbits. Such ructions might also have hurled water-rich comets into the dry inner solar system, which could explain massive crater fields on our moon, and perhaps even the existence of oceans on Earth (<i>New Scientist</i>, 25 November 2006, p 40).</p>
<p>That is still a relatively sedate history on the evidence of other solar systems, yet it did not occur to us to ask whether our neck of the woods might be strange. The multiplicity of oddball planets, we thought, said more about the limitations of our observations than the prevalence of solar systems like ours.</p>
<p>This is because almost all the early discoveries were made using the Doppler, or radial velocity, technique. This looks for changes to stars' motion caused by tiny gravitational tugs from orbiting planets. Such tugs are bigger for more massive planets orbiting closer in - so if hot Jupiters can exist at all, it is no surprise that we see very many of them.</p>
<p>A similar bias affects transit photometry, a technique first demonstrated in 2000 by two teams, one involving Latham and one involving Marcy (<i>The Astrophysical Journal</i>, vol 529, p L41 and L45). If a planet happens to be aligned so that during its orbit it crosses, or transits, the face of its star as viewed from Earth, its shadow can be detected as a slight dimming in the star's light.</p>
<p>With sufficient sensitivity this method can detect smaller rocky planets in a star's habitable zone where liquid water can exist. Finding planets of any size in a system's outer reaches is more problematic. Here, the large separation between the planet and the star reduces the probability of transit alignments, and the greater time between transits makes observation even more unlikely. Viewed from afar Jupiter, for example, would cross the face of the sun only once every 12 years.</p>
<p>Not seeing the outer reaches of solar systems is a big stumbling block to finding one that resembles ours - and one that might support life. "We need to understand things further out if we want to understand a system's habitability at all," says Scott Gaudi of Ohio State University in Columbus. Comets unleashed by wandering giant planets may have supplied the water that kicked Earth into life, but equally could exterminate any life already present on an inner planet. Finding and categorising outer giants in other solar systems would be a significant step towards understanding how likely such processes are.</p>
<p>A decade ago, Gaudi and his colleague Andrew Gould set out to find planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune's ilk using a technique called gravitational microlensing. This exploits Einstein's prediction that massive objects bend the fabric of space. If a star passes in front of a much more distant background star, it will focus the light from the distant star just as a lens would. If the foreground star has planets, they can produce a smaller, secondary focusing effect, the size of which depends on the planets' masses and orbital distances.</p>
<h2>Wandering giants</h2>
<p>The chances of seeing this effect are astronomically low; large swathes of sky with hundreds of thousands of stars must be monitored to catch its rare occurrences, only a handful of which can be conclusively ascribed to planets. Crucially, though, the secondary lensing effect is strongest when the planet is both large and well-separated from its star - like Jupiter, in other words.</p>
<p>Gould and Gaudi's first analysis in 2000 took in the sparse microlensing data then available, and drew a blank: there seemed to be no giant planets out there in the right place at all. Since then, tens of millions of stars have been tracked, providing thousands more microlensing events. In January last year, the duo announced the results of a new statistical analysis. Starting with the assumption that all the solar systems spotted would have outer planets like ours, they concluded that, given possible variations in how the planets would be configured, six such systems should have been seen. In fact, the tally was one: a red dwarf star with two outer planets analogous to Jupiter and Saturn (<i>Science</i>, vol 319, p 927).</p>
<p>Ramped-up Doppler searches have had a little more success, discovering about 20 Jupiter-sized exoplanets in Jupiter-like orbits. But only two or three of these planets are on near-circular orbits. The rest are eccentrically wandering giants that make life difficult not just for our theories, but for life itself. Their odd orbits would almost undoubtedly disrupt the circular paths of any accompanying Earth-like worlds, potentially casting them into the star or ejecting them from the system.</p>
<p>All this makes the status of our solar system increasingly clear. "Our system is a rarity, there's no longer a question about that," says Marcy. "The only question that remains is, just how rare is it?"</p>
<p>It is an opportune moment to ask: NASA's Kepler space telescope, launched in May 2009, promises a flood of new planets of all sizes. Early indications are that solar systems like ours are as elusive as ever. Take the system Kepler-11, revealed with great fanfare in February this year (<i>Nature</i>, vol 470, p 53). Its six transiting planets are between two and four times the size of Earth, and five of them would be within the orbit of Mercury. Based on their size and estimated density, all six worlds appear to be composed mainly of ice and gas, as if they formed far from their star.</p>
<p>How they migrated inward so gracefully is a mystery. Any ancient convulsions, we had supposed, would leave migrating worlds' orbits out of kilter. But Kepler-11's architecture is proportionally flatter than a vinyl record - far flatter than the planetary orbits in our own solar system, which lie around the equator of our sun only to within about 5 degrees either way. A third of the candidate planets found by Kepler so far seem to reside in similarly pancake-like configurations, implying a history even more sedate than ours.</p>
<p>"The diversity of these planetary systems tells us that our own is but one example in a very wide range," says Andrew Howard, a planet-hunter at the University of California, Berkeley. But it is not quite time to give up on another solar system that looks like ours, he adds. For Kepler to "find" a planet, that planet must transit across its star three times. Given a planned mission lifetime of three and a half years, Earth would have made the cut - just. But it would take 36 years for Jupiter to make the grade, 90 for Saturn, and even longer for Uranus and Neptune. "If we were looking from outside we still wouldn't have detected most of our solar system," says Howard.</p>
<h2 class="greybox">The search for a second Earth</h2>
<p>While astronomers seek a planetary system that mimics the architecture of our own, the number of Earth-like worlds is another open question.</p>
<p>In October last year, Andrew Howard and Geoff Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, released a census of planets orbiting within a quarter of the Earth-sun distance of 150 nearby sun-like stars. A few per cent have close-in planets Jupiter's size or greater, about twice as many have Neptune-mass planets, and at least 12 per cent harbour planets three times Earth's mass, the smallest in the sample. This trend would suggest that one in four sun-like stars have close-in planets Earth's size (<i>Science</i>, vol 330, p 653).</p>
<p>"It tells us that nature makes small planets," says Howard. And while life as we know it would be burned out on these planets, if there are that many planets close in, there are presumably quite a few further out at Earth-like distances.</p>
<p>NASA's Kepler spacecraft is looking for transiting worlds in more than 150,000 stars within a small patch of sky in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra. Its latest batch of data, unveiled on 2 February, contained around 1200 candidate planets, despite representing only a tenth of Kepler's slated three and a half year mission time. Tantalisingly, a handful of them were about the size of Earth.</p>
