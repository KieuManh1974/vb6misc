<p>THOSE who are easily distracted from the task in hand may have "too much brain".</p>
<p>So says Ryota Kanai at University College London. His team found that people who scored highly on a questionnaire rating distractability had larger than average volumes of grey matter in a brain region called the left superior parietal lobe, or SPL (<i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>, DOI: 10.1523/jneurosci.5864-10.2011).</p>
<p>Why a large left SPL might make someone easily distracted is unclear, but Kanai's team is testing whether controlling its activity can improve concentration. They have found "some signs" that attention levels can be regulated by using transcranial direct stimulation on the left SPL. This non-invasive technique delivers a tiny electrical current to the area.</p>
<p>Kanai says the technique might one day help people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
