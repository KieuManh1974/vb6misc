			2020 vision: Digital wallets will empty faster
		
		</h2>
<p><b>Read more:</b> "Seven technologies to disrupt the next decade"</p>
<p>Anthropologists know there are three things most of us now carry with us wherever we go: our keys, our wallets and our cellphones. Digital wallets could fold the last two into a single item - and perhaps eradicate cash altogether. Could it change how we spend too?</p>
<p>A digital wallet is a chip inside your phone that uses wireless "near-field communications" technology. Pre-charged with money or able to request a sum from your bank later, the wallet hands over payment when you swipe it over a retailer's card reader. Cellphone users in Japan have used them for years, but the technology is only now emerging in a big way elsewhere. It is set to transform the payment industry, because mobile and web companies such as Apple, Nokia and Google are keen to rub shoulders with incumbents like Visa.</p>
<p>Since your phone signal can pinpoint where you are, it means businesses could conceivably monitor your location as well as your spending patterns, which would be valuable data to retailers. Businesses could direct personal advertisements at shoppers whenever they step in store.</p>
<p>Processing such payments is less expensive than credit cards, so they can cope with very small transactions. And they are faster, too: swipe payments speed up processing.</p>
<p>Retailers know that faster transaction times mean shorter queues, so digital wallets could bump up sales. But the technology could also prompt us to spend more. Credit cards encourage higher expenditure than paying with cash. But a large pilot held by Citibank in India in 2009 found that contactless payments are even worse. In shops and restaurants across Bangalore, customers who only had to swipe spent as much as 230 per cent the usual amount.</p>
