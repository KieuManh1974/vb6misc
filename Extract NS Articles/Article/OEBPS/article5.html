<p>CALL it a pre-emptive shutdown. The Hamaoka nuclear plant, considered one of the world's most perilous because it sits astride the junction of two major geological faults, will be closed pending the construction of a giant protective sea wall.</p>
<p>Some 200 kilometres south of Tokyo in the coastal city of Omaezaki, Hamaoka was thought to be the most vulnerable Japanese plant - before the March tsunami hit the Fukushima nuclear complex to the north of the capital. In 2004, seismologist Katsuhiko Ishibashi at Kobe University in Japan compared Hamaoka to a kamikaze terrorist waiting to explode.</p>
<p>Chubu Electric Power Company, which runs the plant, announced that it would close two of its five reactors following an order from the prime minister, Naoto Kan. Kan said there is a high chance of a magnitude-8 quake in the area within 30 years.</p>
<p>Of the five reactors, two were already mothballed and another was closed for inspection. The closure of the remaining two functioning reactors could intensify Japan's electricity supply crisis in the wake of the megaquake in March. The plan is to keep them closed until a 15-metre-high sea wall is built, which could take up to three years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at Fukushima, radiation levels of up to 700 millisieverts per hour have been recorded in some parts of reactor number 1. Officials say the radiation will not affect the schedule to create a stable cooling system, expected to be completed by October at the earliest.</p>
