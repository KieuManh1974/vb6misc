			Static charge provides clue to age of fingerprints
		
		</h2>
<p>JUSTICE will be done more often: a new method of fingerprint analysis could not only detect prints but also reveal when they were made.</p>
<p>Techniques for capturing a fingerprint are far from perfect. Besides the well-known method of dusting, there are several more sophisticated ways of detecting fingerprints, but all have limitations. Software analysis and chemical agents can often enhance a fingerprint, but can sometimes muddle the pattern instead. And while atomic force microscopy can pick up fingerprint residues precisely, the technique scans such a small area at a time that it can often take hours to assemble a single print.</p>
<p>Now Robert Prance and colleagues at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK, have developed a way to capture fingerprints by looking at the small amount of static charge left behind when a finger makes contact with an insulating surface such as plastic or glass.</p>
<p>The team passed an electrode over two fingerprints on a piece of plastic and measured the change in voltage as it passed over the surface. Within 75 minutes, the technique had revealed the prints with "comparable quality to conventional fingerprint images", says Prance.</p>
<p>By performing the same measurement each day for 14 days, the team was also able to show how the charge decayed over time (<i>Forensic Science International</i>, DOI: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2011.02.024).</p>
<p>While the method still needs to be tested on different surfaces and under various conditions, Prance says it could be used to work out when a fingerprint was made.</p>
<p>The technique could therefore provide clues as to when a crime was committed, or exclude people from an investigation if their fingerprints were made before or after the crime is known to have taken place. "This is a significant advantage over more conventional fingerprint enhancement methods," says Glenn Porter, a forensic scientist at the University of Western Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>The main limitation of the technique is that it only works with prints left on insulating surfaces. If a fingerprint is left on a conducting material, such as a metal bullet casing, the charge deposited would simply flow away.</p>
