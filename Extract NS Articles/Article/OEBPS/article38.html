<p>I first took Geoffrey Miller's piece on the role of mating intelligence in the courtship of Prince William and Kate Middleton (23 April, p 36) to be a spoof.</p>
<p>Reading on, I realised it was an intentional panegyric, being highly selective with the attributes of both and stretching a point well beyond credulity.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that two individuals of privilege, meeting at an "elite" university and with sufficient in common, struck up and consolidated a relationship, however tortuous the process might have been.</p>

<p>I noted in your editorial on royal nuptials that the much-publicised wedding was of a "probable future king and queen of England".</p>
<p>Does that mean that here in Scotland we shall be free to re-establish the Stuart dynasty, should we so choose?</p>
