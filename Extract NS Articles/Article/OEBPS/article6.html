<p>SATURN's moon Titan could be the site of the first extraterrestrial boating expedition.</p>
<p>Last week, NASA awarded $3 million to a team led by Ellen Stofan at Proxemy Research in Gaithersburg, Maryland, to flesh out the concept of a flying-saucer-shaped space boat called the Titan Mare Explorer, or TiME.</p>
<p>Titan is the only place in our solar system with a liquid cycle analogous to Earth's water cycle. There, hydrocarbon rain tops up lakes of methane and ethane. TiME would parachute into a lake in the northern hemisphere called Ligeia Mare, where it would bob around for three months, testing the lake's chemicals with a mass spectrometer. This could reveal unusual patterns in the abundance of organic molecules that might hint at life, says Stofan.</p>
<p>In order to fly, TiME will have to out-compete two other proposed missions: a seismic monitoring station for Mars, and a comet-hopping probe. The winner will be chosen after a review in 2012 and could launch in 2016.</p>
