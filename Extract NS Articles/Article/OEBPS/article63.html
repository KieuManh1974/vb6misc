			Research notes from the wild side
		
		</h2>
<p>Field Notes on Science and Nature<i> is an enthusiasm-filled tour through the indispensable scientific tool that is the field journal</i></p>
<p>RETURNING from fieldwork in Tasmania, I was thrilled to find this book on my desk. <i>Field Notes on Science and Nature</i> celebrates the phenomenon that is the field journal, a fundamental tool for scientific research in the wilds.</p>
<p>This compendium comprises essays written by renowned scientists like mammalogists George Schaller and Jonathan Kingdon, and plant biologist James L. Reveal. Based on their own journals, and replete with illustrations lifted straight from their field notes, the essays not only provide an insight into the minds of world-class researchers but also address broader questions about the function and meaning of the field journal.</p>
<p>Part narrative chronicle, part instructive manual, the book addresses questions like why should field journals be kept, what are they used for and how should people go about compiling them? In providing answers, the authors celebrate the field of scientific natural history and relate the era of gentleman scientists to the professionalised practice of the present day.</p>
<p>The authors draw on their own experiences, explaining the kinds of questions they are investigating and the types of data they collect, while providing charming insights into how their interests in natural history developed and what life in the field is really like.</p>
<p>Opinions seem to vary, though, regarding for whom field journals are written and the kind of information they should contain. Some authors stick to hard data and scientific methods, but others add their musings and accounts of personal experiences to the mix. Although the contributors often claim their scribblings are for their eyes only, for use as repositories for nascent thoughts and their experiences, mentions abound of famous field notes that have yielded notable publications.</p>
<p>While the solid observations have indeed gone on to be used in peer-reviewed publications, the more Darwinesque-style human stories make for the most enjoyable parts of the book. These stories show the delightful humanity behind the scientific studies. Natural history is celebrated as exploration; reports of rigorous field work are enriched by human experience. The anecdotes relayed in the field notes give a sense of the adventure inherent to life in the wilds. Such accounts, rather than diminishing objectivity, add a layer crucial to understanding the reality of this kind of science.</p>
<p>The collection also contains best-practice guidelines for keeping a field journal. Scientific illustrator Jenny Keller's guide to drawing in the field gives useful and achievable suggestions to help even the least-skilled artists. For the benefit of pencilophobes, Conservation International's Piotr Naskrecki explores the more technological approaches to modern note-taking, though these are bemoaned by many as being unreliable.</p>
<p><i>Field Notes on Science and Nature</i> covers most disciplines where researchers head out into nature: zoology, palaeontology, ecology, ethology, anthropology and botany. And although it isn't covered specifically, much of the content also applies to archaeology.</p>
<p>While the history and current practice of taking field notes are well covered, it is a shame that the essays make little mention of how this practice might change in the future. I wonder whether the blogging generation may be predisposed to diarising in the field. Will we see a swing back towards the journalistic styles popular with the naturalists of the 18th and 19th centuries?</p>
<p>The contributors' enthusiasm and informed guidance will ring true with anyone who has spent time in the field. Although few will have the dubious privilege of having their every scribbling archived, valuable lessons are there for everyone armed with a pen and paper. In fact, the vivacity of the essays will inspire many to pick up a pencil and venture into the wild. I for one am left itching to get back to the bush to put what I've read here into practice.</p>
