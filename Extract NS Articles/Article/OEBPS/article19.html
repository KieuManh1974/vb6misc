<p>LURKING in the swamps, mangroves and coral reefs of the west Pacific is a fish that makes the same type of urgent call we associate with a screaming baby.</p>
<p>The three-spined toadfish, <i>Batrachomoeus trispinosus</i> (pictured), is not the only fish that vocalises, but it is the first one known to produce a range of calls known as non-linear.</p>
<p>Other fish make linear sounds, which have a regular waveform a bit like a sine wave. In non-linear sounds, however, different waveforms interfere with one another as they travel, creating a much more complex signal. Human babies, other mammals and songbirds use non-linear sounds in their calls, and animals associate such sounds with a sense of urgency. Aaron Rice at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, recorded the calls of captive three-spined toadfish and noticed that some of the waveforms produced contained short but complicated patterns. Intrigued, he showed them to Cornell engineer Bruce Land, who immediately recognised them as non-linear.</p>
<p>With colleague Andrew Bass, Rice recorded a further 1200 calls from his captive toadfish, and found that 38 per cent were non-linear. For instance, the fish could produce biphonic calls, a trick used by songbirds that gives the animal two distinct but simultaneous voices.</p>
<p>The key to the toadfish's talkativeness is its unusual swim bladder. This gas-filled organ is normally used to maintain buoyancy, but by manipulating a nearby muscle it can be made to resonate and so double as an organ of vocalisation. The three-spined toadfish's swim bladder is unique because it is divided in two. Each half is controlled by a separate nerve and muscle, so can produce sound independently. Two closely related species<img src="/img/icon/artx_video.gif" alt="Movie Camera" title="Contains video content" class="artxicon" /> with single swim bladders cannot make non-linear sounds (<i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>, DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2011.0656).</p>
<p>"This fish has essentially doubled its vocal organ," says Tecumseh Fitch of the University of Vienna in Austria.</p>
<p>We don't know why non-linear sounds are used for urgent calls, says Simon Townsend of the University of Zurich in Switzerland. It may be that non-linear sounds are produced if an animal loses control of its vocal system when upset, and that other animals have simply evolved to associate such sounds with stress.</p>
