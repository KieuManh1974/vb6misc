<p>I enjoyed the feature on rebuilding civilisation from scratch (26 March, p 40). I applaud the idea that we would stop using expensively treated drinking water to flush away waste. I'd like to add another: I believe we waste energy in constructing and operating buildings more than, say, 10 storeys high. At the same time we are faced with energy constraints and increasingly obese populations.</p>
<p>Why transport all that material, fittings and furniture up to the clouds, pump water to the top, put us in boxes and spend the next 50 years winching us all up and down? Why not build on a human scale and use the stairs.</p>
