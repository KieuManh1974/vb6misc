			Beware Higgs impostors at the LHC
		
		</h2>
<p>NEW particles that mimic the long-sought Higgs boson may bamboozle physicists, who could spend years trying to confirm or rule out the possibility of an impostor, a new study warns.</p>
<p>The standard model of particle physics predicts that a particle called the Higgs boson endows many other particles with mass. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, was built in part to detect and study it for the first time.</p>
<p>Higgs bosons should be produced in the wreckage of collisions between pairs of protons smashed together at the LHC. While the Higgs will not be detected directly, it should quickly decay into more familiar particles, such as pairs of photons or heavy Z bosons, carriers of the weak nuclear force. The standard model of particle physics predicts what fraction of the occasions the Higgs should decay into each type of particle, so if decay products are seen in those ratios, we might assume we have finally found the Higgs.</p>
<p>But some other undiscovered particle could decay in the same pattern, say Patrick Fox of Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, and colleagues, in a paper posted online (arxiv.org/abs/1104.5450). "This was a surprisingly easy thing to arrange," says team member Neal Weiner of New York University, as such mimicry could occur as a result of a quantum phenomenon called mixing. Mixing allows particles to exist as a blend of two different types, and is known to occur between types of quark and between types of neutrino. If there is a new particle that mixes with the Higgs boson, it will pick up some characteristics of the Higgs.</p>
<p>What would make the disguise almost perfect is if the new particle does not feel the forces of the standard model. Then it would have no intrinsic tendency to decay into standard-model particles. Then even a slight Higgs admixture would make the new particle decay in exactly the same ways as the Higgs, with exactly the same decay products. Ian Low of Argonne National Laboratory in DuPage County, Illinois, who was not a member of the team, agrees that mixing could lead to convincing impostors. "Nature might surprise us," he says.</p>
<p>While such an impostor would at least imply that the Higgs does exist - a triumph in itself - it would not tell physicists about the long-sought particle's detailed properties. In particular, the mass of the counterfeit could be very different from that of the genuine article.</p>
<p>It could be an exciting discovery in other ways, because not just any new particle could mimic the Higgs. To do so, it would need to have zero spin, like the Higgs boson itself but unlike any other standard-model particle. Such spin-zero particles arise in theories that include new forces beyond those in the standard model. Some physicists think a new force could explain a variety of anomalies seen recently at the Tevatron particle collider at Fermilab.</p>
<p>If a particle with Higgs-like decays is found at the LHC, it could take years to rule out the possibility that it is an impostor. The best prospect to weed it out would come after an LHC upgrade planned for 2014, when higher-energy collisions should reveal whether the new particle interacts with carriers of the weak force - a property expected for the Higgs boson but not for impostors.</p>
